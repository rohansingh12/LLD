## Rules
1. The game is played on a board numbered from `1` to `N` (default is 100).
2. Players start at position `0`.
3. Players roll the dice and move forward by the number rolled.
4. If a player lands at the start of a ladder, they climb to the end of the ladder.
5. If a player lands at the head of a snake, they slide down to the tail of the snake.
6. The first player to reach or exceed the last cell wins.

## How It Works
The game operates as follows:
1. Players are added to a queue, which dictates their turn order.
2. Each player rolls a dice during their turn and moves their token forward.
3. The board determines if the new position contains a snake or ladder and updates the playerâ€™s position accordingly.
4. The game continues until a player reaches the goal.
